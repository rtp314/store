# Store

A simple storefront website integrating the Stripe API.

Frontend built with React and Typescript, backend built with Express and Stripe.

## To Run:

Simply clone the repo, `cd` into the folder, `npm i` then `npm run start`.

You can work on the frontend separately by running `npm run dev` inside the `frontend` folder. When finished, run `npm run build` inside the `frontend` folder to build the changes, which will then be served in the `public` folder by the Express server.
